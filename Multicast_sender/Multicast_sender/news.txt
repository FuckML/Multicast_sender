Scala is angry the new Fifa council will have the ability to appoint and sack those in charge of its committees, including auditing, ethics and finance.
The council replaced the Fifa executive committee in the aftermath of a corruption scandal at the organisation.
Committees had been "deprived of their independence", said Scala.
Fifa said the Swiss "has made unfounded claims which are baseless".
Scala says he is "consternated" by a decision that makes it possible for the council to "impede" investigations by either dismissing committee members or "through the threat of a dismissal".
